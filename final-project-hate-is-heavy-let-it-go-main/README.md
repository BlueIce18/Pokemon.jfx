# Final Project

**LibGDX**
Our file is in the "Test" folder. Our code is primarly in core ==> src ==> com ==> mygdx ==> game ==> bunch of files

REQUIRED FEATURES:
Comments and naming conventions (javadoc!) - DONE	                               	
Programs complexity is sufficient for grade 12 level - DONE            		
Modular OO program using built-in and custom subroutines: - DONE     		
User friendly design(E.g. Start screens ect.) - DONE (start, instructions, select, arena, end, open world)                           	  	
Effective data structures have been selected - DONE    	                    		
Loops and conditional statements have been used effectively - DONE  		
Array or List is used effectively - DONE (used for storing information about pokemon)                 		
Read and write to external files - DONE (saving pokemon teams)  

EXTRA FEATURE LIST:
- Program is organized effectively
- Program includes replayability, many different combinations of pokemons to play as or against and can choose matchups to make gameplay harder or easier.
- Game includes multiple types of gameplay (open world, arena)
- Game saves presets of pokemon lineup of players choosing and can load them back in
- Polished look of the game
- Accurate pathing done throughout the entire open world
- Program uses much of a pokemons information for its battles (type,damage,speed, etc.)
^ this means that not only are different pokemon better or worse matchups for each other, the order they attack in 
is also based on their speed. Battles are strategic and player has to decide between damage, accuracy, and attack type for what move they want to do while considering the enemies speed, health, and resistance/weakness to certain attack types
- Able to switch between pokemon at any time 
- levels lock and unlock based on how far into the game the player is
- The number of pokemon team combinations and unique attacks makes for a unique experience where player can experiment
with which team they like the most based on attack damage and accuracy, and types
-Start, help, and end screen
